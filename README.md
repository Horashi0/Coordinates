Hello, this python code gets your coordinates automatically or manually depending on what option you have selected. It then automatically opens google maps with your coordinates.

Please note, for this to work you will need to create an account at https://openweathermap.org/ then create an API key and input this key into where it specifies into the code and BOOM! You now have a automatic coordinate grabber.
